            <h2>Coleslaw</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>It's light, fresh and very healthy</h3>
            <p>Coleslaw! Envisioning bland mounds of limp cabbage? You're not alone.
             But a great coleslaw can be so much more. Make sure you have juicy fresh cabbage 
             for this one. Toss with a little vinegar and mayonnaise and you're all set. 
             Ah, that's crisp. </p>

            <hr>
            <h3>Sweet and satisfying... The sugar gives it a hint of caramel</h3>
            <p>Glazed Yams! It's yam season, and what better way to enjoy these delightful tubers
                than by slathering them in a sweet, sticky glaze? You'll need a nice, ripe yam and 
                a whole bunch of sugar. Now, here's how you do it... </p>

            <h2>Trout Soup</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Pretty salty</h3>
            <p>Trout Soup! There's something about fresh-caught trout that just gets me buzzing. 
                Maybe it's the subtle taste of the river. At any rate, I've got a wonderful trout 
                soup recipe to share with you today... </p>

            <hr>
            <h3>Fish and rice wrapped in seaweed</h3>
            <p>Maki Roll! The delicate flavor of the ocean, sealed within a pillowy cloud of rice.
                 Maybe a bit of wasabi for the adventurous. My mouth is watering as we speak. 
                 Oh, how I love sushi... </p>

            <hr>
            <h3>It has a soothing effect</h3>
            <p>Poppyseed Muffin! Poppies make beautiful ornamental flowers... but why not make 
                full use of the plant with these delightful muffins? I'm a huge fan of poppy seeds. 
                They're subtle, but they add a nice flavor and a great texture to bready desserts. 
                And they're healthy! </p>

            <h3>There's little heart candies on top</h3>
            <p>A viewer from Pelican Town wrote to me recently... let's see... Her name's Haley. 
                She wrote, 'I tried your pink cake last time I was in Zuzu City and I fell in love 
                with it. Could you share the recipe on your next episode?'. Well, why not? It's a 
                marvelous cake. And you'll never guess the secret ingredient... melon! </p>

            <h3>Crispy and golden-brown!</h3>
            <p>Hashbrowns! This one's simple, but that's a good thing! You'll just want to shred 
                some potatoes, add a liberal amount of salt, and fry to perfection in your favorite 
                high-heat oil. Sounds easy, right? Well, I've got some pointers that'll make your 
                job a lot easier... </p>

            <hr>
            <h3>It's cool and refreshing</h3>
            <p>Artichoke Dip! This is a delightful way to get more artichokes into your body. 
                Personally, I don't even dip anything in there. I just guzzle the sauce down 
                like it's a milkshake. Delicious. </p>
